Tools for machine learnt interatomic potentials

## Getting started

### Dependencies

`janus-core` dependencies currently include:

- Python >= 3.9
- ASE >= 3.23
- mace-torch = 0.3.6
- chgnet = 0.3.8 (optional)
- matgl = 1.1.3 (optional)
- sevenn = 0.10.0 (optional)
- alignn = 2024.5.27 (optional)

All required and optional dependencies can be found in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

> [!NOTE]
> Where possible, we expect to update pinned MLIP dependencies to match their latest releases, subject to any required API fixes.


### Installation

The latest stable release of `janus-core`, including its dependencies, can be installed from PyPI by running:

```
python3 -m pip install janus-core
```

To get all the latest changes, `janus-core` can also be installed from GitHub:

```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/stfc/janus-core.git
```

By default, MACE is the only MLIP installed.

Other MLIPs can be installed as `extras`. For example, to install CHGNet and M3GNet, run:

```python
python3 -m pip install janus-core[chgnet,m3gnet]
```

or to install all supported MLIPs:

```python
python3 -m pip install janus-core[all]
```

Individual `extras` are listed in [Getting Started](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/getting_started/getting_started.html#installation), as well as in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) under `[tool.poetry.extras]`.


### Further help

Please see [Getting Started](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/getting_started/getting_started.html),
as well as guides for janus-core's [Python](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/user_guide/python.html)
and [command line](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/user_guide/command_line.html) interfaces,
for additional information, or [open an issue](https://github.com/stfc/janus-core/issues/new) if something doesn't seem right.

## Command line interface

All supported MLIP calculations are accessible through subcommands of the `janus` command line tool, which is installed with the package:

```shell
janus singlepoint
janus geomopt
janus md
janus phonons
janus eos
janus train
janus descriptors
```

For example, a single point calcuation (using the [MACE-MP](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp) "small" force-field) can be performed by running:

```shell
janus singlepoint --struct tests/data/NaCl.cif --arch mace_mp --model-path small
```

A description of each subcommand, as well as valid options, can be listed using the `--help` option. For example,

```shell
janus singlepoint --help
```

prints the following:

```shell
Usage: janus singlepoint [OPTIONS]

  Perform single point calculations and save to file.

Options:
  --struct PATH        Path of structure to simulate.  [required]
  --arch TEXT          MLIP architecture to use for calculations.  [default:
                       mace_mp]
  --device TEXT        Device to run calculations on.  [default: cpu]
  --model-path TEXT    Path to MLIP model.  [default: None]
  --properties TEXT    Properties to calculate. If not specified, 'energy',
                       'forces' and 'stress' will be returned.
  --out PATH           Path to save structure with calculated results. Default
                       is inferred from name of structure file.
  --read-kwargs DICT   Keyword arguments to pass to ase.io.read. Must be
                       passed as a dictionary wrapped in quotes, e.g. "{'key'
                       : value}".  [default: "{}"]
  --calc-kwargs DICT   Keyword arguments to pass to selected calculator. Must
                       be passed as a dictionary wrapped in quotes, e.g.
                       "{'key' : value}". For the default architecture
                       ('mace_mp'), "{'model':'small'}" is set unless
                       overwritten.
  --write-kwargs DICT  Keyword arguments to pass to ase.io.write when saving
                       results. Must be passed as a dictionary wrapped in
                       quotes, e.g. "{'key' : value}".  [default: "{}"]
  --log PATH           Path to save logs to. Default is inferred from the name
                       of the structure file.
  --summary PATH       Path to save summary of inputs, start/end time, and
                       carbon emissions. Default is inferred from the name of
                       the structure file.
  --config TEXT        Configuration file.
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

Please see the [user guide](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/user_guide/command_line.html) for examples of each subcommand.


### Using configuration files

Default values for all command line options may be specifed through a Yaml 1.1 formatted configuration file by adding the `--config` option. If an option is present in both the command line and configuration file, the command line value takes precedence.

For example, with the following configuration file and command:

```yaml
struct: "NaCl.cif"
properties:
  - "energy"
out: "NaCl-results.extxyz"
arch: mace_mp
model-path: medium
calc-kwargs:
  dispersion: True
```

```shell
janus singlepoint --struct KCl.cif --out KCl-results.cif --config config.yml
```

This will run a singlepoint energy calculation on `KCl.cif` using the [MACE-MP](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp) "medium" force-field, saving the results to `KCl-results.cif`.

> [!NOTE]
> `properties` must be passed as a Yaml list, as above, not as a string.

Example configurations for all commands can be found in [janus-tutorials](https://github.com/stfc/janus-tutorials/tree/main/configs)


## Python interface

Calculations can also be run through the Python interface. For example, running:

```python
from janus_core.calculations.single_point import SinglePoint

single_point = SinglePoint(
    struct_path="tests/data/NaCl.cif",
    arch="mace_mp",
    model_path="tests/models/mace_mp_small.model",
)

results = single_point.run()
print(results)
```

will read the NaCl structure file and attach the MACE-MP (medium) calculator, before calculating and printing the energy, forces, and stress.

Jupyter Notebook tutorials illustrating the use of currently available calculations can be found in the [janus-tutorials](https://github.com/stfc/janus-tutorials) repository. This currently includes examples for:

- [Single Point](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stfc/janus-tutorials/blob/main/single_point.ipynb)
- [Geometry Optimization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stfc/janus-tutorials/blob/main/geom_opt.ipynb)
- [Molecular Dynamics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stfc/janus-tutorials/blob/main/md.ipynb)
- [Equation of State](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stfc/janus-tutorials/blob/main/eos.ipynb)
- [Phonons](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stfc/janus-tutorials/blob/main/phonons.ipynb)


## Development

We recommend installing poetry for dependency management when developing for `janus-core`:

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
3. Install `janus-core` with dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stfc/janus-core
cd janus-core
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
poetry install --with pre-commit,dev,docs  # install with useful dev dependencies
pre-commit install  # install pre-commit hooks
pytest -v  # discover and run all tests
```
