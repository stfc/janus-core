# Coding style

We adhere to [pep8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), which is automatically enforced via a pre-commit in the CI.

Please check your code manually before committing. Suggestions for how to perform these checks, as well as additional information about the checks performed, can be found in the [developer guide](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/developer_guide/get_started.html).
